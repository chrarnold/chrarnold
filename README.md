### My activities and repositories

My main repositories from the last years are not here but at a [public institutional Gitlab instance at EMBL](https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg).
While some are public, others are currently not accessible publicly, however.

Selected recent highlights include:
- [**diffTF**](https://difftf.readthedocs.io) ([from this repository](https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/GRaNIE))
- [**GRaNIE Bioconductor/R package**](https://grp-zaugg.embl-community.io/GRaNIE) ([from this repository](https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/diffTF))
- [**Teaching material for our yearly ATAC-Seq course at EMBL**](https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/atac-seq_course_2022)
- **extensive Snakemake pipelines** for different types of NGS data such as bulk RNA-seq, bulk ATAC-seq, ChIP-Seq, ... (not public yet)

One of my all-time favorite projects resulted in a whole webserver that is still working after almost 10 years after setting it up initially:
- [**The 10kTrees Webserver** - Bayesian inference of primate phylogeny](https://10ktrees.nunn-lab.org)


During my PhD, I was more heavily involved in algorithm development and biological/chemical simulations, which resulted in the following software, for example:
-  [**StoChDyn** - Stochastic modeling of chromatin state dynamics across cell divisions and
evolutionary optimization of epigenetic stability](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/StoChDyn)
- [**Targeting** - An efficient software package for solving the Maximal Pairing Problem on arbitrary trees](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/Targeting)

As a developer, I am aware of the importance of identifying bugs in code. Therefore, I am also reporting bugs in various bioinformatics tools whenever I identify them. By now, I indirectly contributed to many bioinformatics-focused repositories and programs (such as `samtools`, `Snakemake`, `bedtools`, and various `R` packages).

### Contact
If you're interested in my work, my future plan, how I could you with your project, I'd love to chat. I am currently working at EMBL in Heidelberg. See above for how to contact me.
