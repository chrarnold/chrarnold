## Thanks for checking my site and contributions

### Who am I?
Data Scientist, Bioinformatician and Snakemake enthusiast at EMBL. See here for more info: <url>https://www.embl.org/groups/zaugg</url>

### My activities and repositories

My main repositories from the last years are not here but at a public institutional Gitlab instance at EMBL: <url>https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg</url>.
While some are public, others are currently not accessible publicly, however.

Selected recent highlights include:
- **diffTF**: <url>https://difftf.readthedocs.io</url> (from this repository: <url> https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/GRaNIE</url>)
- **GRaNIE Bioconductor/R package** <url>https://grp-zaugg.embl-community.io/GRaNIE/</url> (from this repository: <url> https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/diffTF<url>)
- **Teaching material for our yearly ATAC-Seq course at EMBL** (from this repository: https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/atac-seq_course_2022)
- **extensive Snakemake pipelines** for different types of NGS data such as bulk RNA-seq, bulk ATAC-seq, ChIP-Seq, ...

One of my all-time favorite projects resulted in a whole webserver that is still working after almost 10 years after setting it up initially:
- **The 10kTrees Webserver** - Bayesian inference of primate phylogeny (<url>https://10ktrees.nunn-lab.org</url>)


During my PhD, I was more heavily invovled in algorithm development and biological/chemical simulations, which resulted in the following software, for example:
-  **StoChDyn** - Stochastic modeling of chromatin state dynamics across cell divisions and
evolutionary optimization of epigenetic stability (<url>http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/StoChDyn</url>)
- **Targeting** - An efficient software package for solving the Maximal Pairing Problem on arbitrary trees (<url>http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/Targeting</url>)

As a developer, I am aware of the importance of identifying bugs in code. Therefore, I am also reporting bugs in various bioinformatics tools whenever I identify them. By now, I indirectly contributed to many bioinformatics-focused repositories and programs (such as `samtools`, `Snakemake`, `bedtools`, and various `R` packages).
